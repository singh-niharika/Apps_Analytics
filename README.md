## Profitable apps

The aim of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. This will help developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

The apps considered here are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. The goal of this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.


These are two data sets that are being used here for the analysis:

1. A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play

2. A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store
Let's start by opening the two data sets and then continue with exploring the data.
